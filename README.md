# Bento test repro

I documented my experience with the docs of the [bento.de](https://github.com/matthiasrohmer/bento.dev) web components. I assumed creating a portfolio page for a photographer with the given components. The style and markup is completed with dummy content from the examples given in the docs and with images from [unsplash.com](https://www.unsplash.com). Page is far from ready or optimized. It's more a sandbox for the components. 

My experience is documented in a google-sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1y6TQRcWl4dJo46mtEfSxZ7devG4HrarOws-lYFFuu38/edit#heading=h.pwq0yl2ti92z)
